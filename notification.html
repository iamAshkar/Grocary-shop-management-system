A grocery store (AE), grocery shop (BE) or simply grocery
<p>[1] is a store that primarily retails a general range of food products,</p>
<p>[2] which may be fresh or packaged. In everyday U.S. usage, however, "grocery store" is a synonym for supermarket,[3] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries. In the UK, shops that sell food are distinguished as grocers
[3] or grocery shops (though in everyday use, people usually use either the term "supermarket" or a "corner shop"[4] or "convenience shop").</P>
<p>Larger types of stores that sell groceries, such as supermarkets and hypermarkets, usually stock significant amounts of non-food products, such as clothing and household items. Small grocery stores that sell mainly fruit and vegetables are known as greengrocers  or produce markets , and small grocery stores that predominantly sell prepared food, such as candy and snacks, are known as convenience shops or delicatessens.</p>
